**Clock** module:

* Inputs:

  * Initiate module
  * Button press (type: mouse press)

* Outputs:

  * Up to date time for each player sent to display

**Perception** module:

* Inputs:

  * Initiate module
  * Camera feed (internal to module)
  * Global coordinates
  * Game Engine > Action command object:

    * Converts and saves all locations to real-world coordinates

* Outputs:

  * BWE Matrix (type: numpy array)
  * Synchronisation position of End effector?

**Game Engine** module:

* Inputs:

  * BWE Matrix (type: numpy array)

* Outputs:

  * Action command object:

    * Stores whether or not there is a death first
    * Stores the piece type of death
    * Stores location of death
    * Stores move piece type
    * Stores action-move (piece type)
    * Stores action-move-from (location)
    * Stores action-move-to (location)

**Motion** module:

* Inputs:

  * Action command object - takes each command and builds a motion plan around it
