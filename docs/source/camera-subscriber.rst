Description
===========
In this project, a RGBD camera was used to detect FRANKA and the chessboard. This part of the project allows us to fetch a single image from the camera livestream whenever it is needed. It is based on OpenCV and runs on ROS. RGB and depth information collected from the image frame is used in both calibration and perception.
